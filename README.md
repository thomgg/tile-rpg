# Tile-based RPG

[Full Technical Documentation](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/ce301_2019/ce301_wenham_t/-/tree/master/docs)

## Overview
The Tile-based RPG that I have created. 
It is written from scratch – a custom game engine – meaning that all the code is either detailed in the technical documentation or is part of the Java language.
The game is played on a freely explorable grid-based world viewed from a top-down perspective.
The player has access to a range of abilities with which to defeat enemies – using different equipment,
they can use short and long range attacks with different effects.
Enemies are controlled by a simple artificial intelligence that decides how they should move and attack the player.
There is a system for loading levels; text files of a special format can be read to populate the game’s grid system.
All graphics are drawn by me; static objects were made to be repeating when put together.
There is a menu system that allows the creation of hierarchical menus and a user to navigate the menus.
In the game, this is used for an inventory that the player uses to view their items.
